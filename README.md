- The level is created with my level creator: https://github.com/Jekyllina/Unreal_Level_Generator
- Every player has an UI icon that shows if they can drop the bomb or not, they can drop only one bomb at time
- The bomb explodes after 5 seconds
- The green walls can't be destroyed, the stone walls can
- When a player dies he becomes a default pawn
